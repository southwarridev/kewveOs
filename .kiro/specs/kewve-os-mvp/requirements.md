# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing the core foundation of Kewve OS across three critical development phases, targeting both PC (x86_64) and phone (ARM64) platforms. The goal is to build a secure, maintainable, and scalable operating system kernel with modern graphics capabilities and application runtime infrastructure, following Rust best practices and clean architecture principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core OS Foundation

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want a complete OS kernel foundation with interrupt handling, memory management, device drivers, filesystem, and process management, so that I can build higher-level OS features on a solid, secure base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system boots on PC THEN the kernel SHALL initialize the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) with proper exception handlers

2. WHEN the system boots on phone THEN the kernel SHALL initialize ARM64 exception vectors and handlers

3. WHEN an interrupt occurs THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing on both platforms

4. WHEN memory allocation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide paging-based memory management with heap allocation for x86_64 and ARM64

5. WHEN a keyboard key is pressed on PC THEN the system SHALL capture and process the input

6. WHEN touch input occurs on phone THEN the system SHALL capture multi-touch events and gestures

7. WHEN mouse movement occurs on PC THEN the system SHALL track cursor position and button states

8. WHEN storage access is needed THEN the system SHALL provide basic disk I/O operations on both platforms

9. WHEN file operations are requested THEN the system SHALL support a simple filesystem (FAT32 or custom) across platforms

10. WHEN multiple processes need to run THEN the system SHALL provide task scheduling and process management on both architectures

11. WHEN applications need OS services THEN the system SHALL provide a clean system calls interface for both platforms

12. IF any component fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt graceful recovery

### Requirement 2: Graphics and User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, hardware-accelerated graphical interface with window management and touch support, so that I can interact with applications through an intuitive visual environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts on PC THEN it SHALL initialize basic GPU drivers for Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA hardware

2. WHEN the system starts on phone THEN it SHALL initialize mobile GPU drivers for Qualcomm Adreno, ARM Mali, and Apple GPU

3. WHEN graphics operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use wgpu for hardware-accelerated rendering on both platforms

4. WHEN applications create windows on PC THEN the window manager SHALL provide desktop-style compositing and management

5. WHEN applications run on phone THEN the system SHALL provide mobile-optimized fullscreen and overlay management

6. WHEN touch input occurs THEN the system SHALL process multi-touch gestures and events with platform-appropriate handling

7. WHEN the desktop loads on PC THEN it SHALL display a functional shell environment with launcher and taskbar

8. WHEN the home screen loads on phone THEN it SHALL display a mobile-optimized launcher with app grid and gestures

9. WHEN graphics performance is measured THEN it SHALL achieve 60+ FPS for UI animations on both platforms

10. IF GPU initialization fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to software rendering

11. WHEN multiple windows are open THEN the compositor SHALL handle overlapping and transparency appropriately for each platform

### Requirement 3: Application Runtime Infrastructure

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want a secure runtime environment that supports WebAssembly, JavaScript, Windows, Linux, and macOS applications with proper sandboxing and IPC, so that I can deploy universal cross-platform applications safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebAssembly module is loaded THEN the system SHALL execute it securely using wasmtime runtime

2. WHEN JavaScript code runs THEN it SHALL execute in a QuickJS or V8 engine with proper isolation

3. WHEN Windows applications (.exe, .dll, .NET) are loaded THEN the system SHALL run them via Win32 API emulation

4. WHEN Linux applications (ELF, AppImage) are loaded THEN the system SHALL run them via Linux ABI emulation

5. WHEN macOS applications (Mach-O, .app bundles) are loaded THEN the system SHALL run them via macOS ABI emulation

6. WHEN applications are launched THEN they SHALL run in sandboxed containers with limited permissions

7. WHEN apps need to communicate THEN the system SHALL provide secure IPC mechanisms

8. WHEN permission requests occur THEN the system SHALL enforce capability-based security model

9. WHEN malicious code is detected THEN the system SHALL terminate the process and protect the system

10. IF runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL isolate failures to individual applications

11. WHEN performance is critical THEN native app emulation SHALL achieve 80%+ native speed

12. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL translate them to Kewve OS equivalents

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a unified codebase that supports both PC and phone platforms with shared core components and platform-specific optimizations, so that development effort is maximized while maintaining platform-native performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL use conditional compilation for platform-specific features

2. WHEN core components are implemented THEN they SHALL work on both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures

3. WHEN platform differences exist THEN they SHALL be abstracted through trait-based interfaces

4. WHEN building for PC THEN the system SHALL optimize for desktop workflows and peripherals

5. WHEN building for phone THEN the system SHALL optimize for mobile workflows and touch interfaces

6. WHEN memory management differs THEN platform-specific implementations SHALL be provided

7. WHEN power management is needed THEN mobile builds SHALL include battery optimization

8. IF platform features are unavailable THEN graceful degradation SHALL occur

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Architecture

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clean, well-documented, and testable code following Rust best practices, so that the codebase remains maintainable and scalable as the project grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow Rust idioms and best practices

2. WHEN modules are created THEN they SHALL have clear interfaces and minimal coupling

3. WHEN functions are implemented THEN they SHALL be properly documented with rustdoc

4. WHEN features are added THEN they SHALL include comprehensive unit and integration tests

5. WHEN unsafe code is necessary THEN it SHALL be minimized and thoroughly documented

6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled using Result types and proper error propagation

7. WHEN performance is measured THEN critical paths SHALL be optimized and benchmarked

8. IF code quality drops THEN CI/CD SHALL catch issues before merge

### Requirement 6: Development Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust development tools, testing infrastructure, and documentation, so that I can contribute effectively to the project and ensure code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN automated tests SHALL run and pass on both PC and phone targets

2. WHEN builds are triggered THEN they SHALL complete successfully for x86_64 and ARM64 platforms

3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN proper logging and tracing SHALL be available across platforms

4. WHEN documentation is generated THEN it SHALL be comprehensive and up-to-date for both platforms

5. WHEN performance testing occurs THEN benchmarks SHALL track regression on both architectures

6. WHEN security analysis runs THEN it SHALL identify potential vulnerabilities for both platforms

7. IF build failures occur THEN they SHALL be reported with clear error messages for the specific platform

8. WHEN releases are made THEN they SHALL include proper versioning and changelogs for both PC and phone builds
